- # ---Transient Template About
  - This commented-out About page is to provide a [[,aka-thinking-surface|aka-thought-surface]] for improvements to the template.
  - @ *Should I record doc changes?*
    - [[,aka-definition-specced-note]]s,

      - And yet i think doc versions could help provide specific mile stones to a document. A significant knowledge update from its etc or primary source could mean an update.
