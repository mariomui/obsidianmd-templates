## 10-About

> [!info] Hover over me [[~view-for-recent-reference-link-to-note-title-transform,nb.-MUID-115]] and copy normalized note title.

[[,aka-project-specced-note]]s have a desired product at the end, and a desired start and end date. 

- ! DO NOT confuse UMIDs with project notes as UMIDS are only there to facilitate projects that require different files with different names to be organized under one roof.
	- For instance, if i wanted to write a book, it would take in all the things tagged with a specific UMID. This way, I don't get bombarded.
